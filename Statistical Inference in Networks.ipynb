After the introductories, we'll head over there and continue the tutorial. As such, there are no exercises like in the previous tutorials, but a future incarnation of this module may involve that."

But this tutorial is one of the clearest I think I've seen on ERGMs and the data are pretty interesting, both structurally and in terms of the node attributes."

    "So far in this workshop, we've mostly been *describing* the various contours of existing networks, either quantitatively or visually. So why would we want to use statistical inference to understand a network? Primarily, we want to try *to explain and predict tie formation*. We do this to understand the processes which made the network what it is. We predict tie formation based on two classes of variables: node attributes (e.g. gender, age, status) or some network structure (e.g. triangles, number of surrounding edges). \n",

    "Another cool thing about ERGMs is that we can use an ERGM as a generative model. That is, we can simulate new networks based on the estimated parameters from the model."

    "`network` is a network package created by the mathematical sociologist Carter T. Butts at the University of California-Irvine. `network` has its own descriptive and visualization capabilities. The syntax for accessing vertex and edge attributes is similar but different from `igraph`. The visualizations ultimately look more or less similar."
