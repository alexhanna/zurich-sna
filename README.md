# Introduction to Social Network Analysis

## Zurich Summer School in Political Methodology

*July 4-5, 2018*

*Instructor: [Alex Hanna](http://alex-hanna.com), University of Toronto/Google*

Social network analysis is a body of methods for analyzing the structure of social, communicative, and political interactions. In this workshop, we will be covering the basic and intermediate topics in network analysis. We will cover basic network terminology and concepts, network visualization, and descriptive metrics which describe whole networks, individual nodes, and subgroups. We will also cover statistical inference on determinants of network structure. 

There are no readings for this course. Any background information you need will be covered in the workshop.

### A word on pedagogy

My methods pedagogy is hands-on in a way that will force you to be working on your own early in the process. It will also mean you will be frequently failing early and often. Luckily, you are in a group of very smart people who are motivated to learn the topic at hand. 

I also adopt a few pedagogical practices from the [(Software|Data) Carpentries](http://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/) which I'll introduce throughout the course.
